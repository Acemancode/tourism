            <h2>Jamestown Lighthouse</h2>
            <p>The Jamestown Lighthouse is an iconic landmark situated in the historic Jamestown neighborhood of Accra, Ghana. The current 28-meter (92 ft) tall structure, painted with distinctive white and red horizontal bands, was built in the 1930s, replacing an older, smaller lighthouse constructed by the British in 1871. The original purpose of the lighthouse was to guide ships safely into the bustling port of Accra, marking shallow and rocky coastlines.</p>
            <p>The lighthouse consists of a stone tower topped with a lantern and gallery, and it is attached to a keeper's house. From the summit, visitors can enjoy breathtaking panoramic views of Jamestown, the Accra coastline, the fishing harbor, and the Gulf of Guinea, with a visibility range of approximately 30 kilometers (16 nautical miles).</p>

            <h3>Things to See and Do</h3>

                <li><strong>Visit the surrounding area:</strong> Explore the historic Jamestown district, known for its colonial architecture, vibrant street art (especially during the annual Chale Wote Street Art Festival), and the bustling fishing harbor.</li>
                <li><strong>See nearby landmarks:</strong> The lighthouse overlooks James Fort (a former trading post and prison with plans to become a museum) and is close to other historical sites like Ussher Fort.</li>
