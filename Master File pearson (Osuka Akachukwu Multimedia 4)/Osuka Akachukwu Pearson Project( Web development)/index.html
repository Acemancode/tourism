            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Ghana was inhabited by various ancient kingdoms and states before European contact. In 1471, the Portuguese arrived, leading to trade in gold, ivory, and timber. The area became known as the Gold Coast. The slave trade became prominent in the 16th century. The British gradually established control, and in 1874, the Gold Coast became a British Crown Colony. Ghana was the first sub-Saharan African nation to gain independence on March 6, 1957, led by Kwame Nkrumah. The country was renamed Ghana after the ancient Empire of Ghana, believed to be linked to some of the current inhabitants. Post-independence, Ghana experienced periods of political instability and military rule before establishing a democratic system in 1992.</p>

            <h2>Geography</h2>
            <p>Ghana covers an area of approximately 238,533 square kilometers (92,098 sq mi). The landscape varies from coastal savannas and plains to tropical rainforests, the Ashanti uplands, and the Akwapim-Togo ranges. Lake Volta, the world's largest artificial lake by surface area, is a major geographical feature. The climate is tropical, with warm temperatures year-round and two rainy seasons in the south, and one in the north. Ghana is rich in natural resources, including gold, timber, diamonds, bauxite, manganese, and increasingly, petroleum.</p>

            <h2>Culture</h2>
            <p>Ghana has a diverse population with over 100 ethnic groups, each with its own languages and customs. Major groups include the Akan, Ewe, Ga-Adangbe, Mole-Dagbani, Guan, and Gurma. English is the official language, a legacy of British colonial rule, but many Ghanaians are multilingual. Family and community are central to Ghanaian culture, with a strong emphasis on respect for elders. Traditional ceremonies and festivals are an important part of cultural life, marking events like births, marriages, and harvests. Ghanaian arts are rich and varied, including music (like Highlife), dance, textiles (especially Kente cloth), pottery, and wood carving. Ghanaian cuisine features staples like fufu, banku, kenkey, and jollof rice, often accompanied by flavorful soups and stews. Hospitality is a key characteristic of Ghanaians, who are generally known to be warm, friendly, and welcoming.</p>

            <h2>Economy</h2>
            <p>Agriculture is a significant sector, employing a large portion of the population. Ghana is a major exporter of cocoa. Other important exports include gold, timber, and minerals. The service sector is also a significant contributor to the GDP. The discovery of oil has the potential to further boost Ghana's economy.</p>

            <h2>Current Situation (April 9, 2025)</h2>
            <p>As of today, April 9, 2025, Ghana continues to be recognized as a relatively stable democracy in West Africa. It's likely focused on economic development, utilizing its natural resources, and further strengthening its democratic institutions. Being in Accra, you're in the heart of the political and economic activity of the nation. The capital city is a bustling hub reflecting the country's energy and cultural mix.</p>
